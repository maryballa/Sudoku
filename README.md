# Sudoku
## Overview
This project started as a follow-along exercise from a video tutorial (linked below).
I built upon the original example and modified the code to add a sudoku puzzle generator.

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to learn how to use Java Swing by implementing a GUI.

## Modifications
 - Added a Sudoku puzzle generator
 - Added int arrays instead of String arrays to achieve multiple puzzles
 - Changed the color of the buttons when a number is completed using a counter

## GUI
This is what the game looks like after completing all the steps from the video.

One feature I added is changing the color of the buttons when a number is completed.
